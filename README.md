# 🩺 Virtual Doctor Assistant

An AI-powered **medical assistant web app** built with **Streamlit** and hosted on **Render**.  
It uses Hugging Face models (via OpenAI-compatible API) to provide safe, doctor-style suggestions.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This app does **not** replace a real doctor. Always consult a qualified physician.
